alzheimer 0.9

This kernel module erases all the available 
physical memory (RAM) when loaded.
This of course leads to machine "crash" (actually infinite loop).
Use ipmi to restart your server after module is loaded.

Purpose of this module is to prevent physical attacks against RAM. 
Find some events (such as connectivity loss,
cover open, ...) and hook this module on them.
When such event occurs, RAM is immediately erased.
Assuming that you are using full disk encryption
with strong cryptographic algorithm, there 
should be (almost;) no way to get your data.

Tested on i386 and x86_64, feel free to port it on 
different architecture. XXX Multiprocesor systems may not work XXX

If you want to test if it really works,
easiest way is probably using qemu + gdb.
 
Under GNU GPL.

Bug reports and patches welcome.

Usage:

$ make

To delete memory:

# insmod alzheimer.ko
(good bye;)

You will probably want to hook deleting to some event.
Script hook.sh is generic hook to connectivity loss,
modify it as you need.
